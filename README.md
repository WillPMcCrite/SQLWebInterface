# SQLWebInterface
For this project, I created an SQL database for a hypothetical bookstore and populated it with data. From there, I created a backend php file (query.php) to communicate with that database. I then wrote a small html file (index.html) for a user interface so that you can type SQL queries into a text box.

The link for the interface is: http://www.auburn.edu/~wpm0026

Feel free to come up with your own queries to practice your SQL! I have included some pre-written queries for you to try out as well.
