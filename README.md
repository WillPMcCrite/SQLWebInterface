# SQLWebInterface
For this project, I created an SQL database for a hypothetical bookstore and populated it with data. From there, I created a backend php file (query.php) to communicate with that database. I then wrote a small html file (index.html) for a user interface so that you can type SQL queries into a text box.

The link for the interface is: http://www.auburn.edu/~wpm0026

I have included a file called sql.txt that has some prewritten queries and what their results should be. Feel free to check out the MainScript.sql and the .csv files within the Data folder to come up with some queries of your own!
